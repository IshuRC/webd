    <h2><strong>Descriptive paragraphs</strong></h2>
<p>
  Common in fiction and certain styles of journalistic or other nonfiction writing,
 a descriptive paragraph contains various details of the same thing, with each
 sentence adding new insight. A paragraph in a horror novel might describe how
 it feels walking around the woods alone; a love letter’s paragraph might focus
 on the details of your significant other’s eyes. No matter the context,
 descriptive paragraphs are meant to provide the clearest picture of your subject.

<h2><strong>Persuasive paragraphs</strong></h2>
<p>
  For editorials and opinion pieces, persuasive paragraphs are meant to convince
the reader of a specific point, with each sentence presenting evidence or
reasoning to support that point. Like expository paragraphs, persuasive paragraphs
 may contain data and statistics, but here, these work to support an opinion
 rather than verify a fact. The trick to writing persuasive paragraphs is knowing
  how to assert your opinion without sounding preachy.
